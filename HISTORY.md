# Breaking updates and feature summaries across releases

## PEtab 3.9.0

Updating plotting functionality. The waterfall plot will now, based on the magnitude of likelihood values, decide between a log or linear scale. Moreover, an automatic re-scaling of the y-axis is now applied if the waterfall plot should be on log-scale, and there are negative likelihood values.

## PEtab 3.8.0

Update to use Catalyst.jl version 15.

## PEtab 3.7.0

Add the `get_system` utility function. This function retrieves the `PEtabODEProblem` model system (either a `ReactionSystem` or an `ODESystem`) along with its associated species and parameter maps for any chosen simulation condition.

## PEtab 3.6.0

Update petab-select to version 0.3. This only changes internals, the user interface for PEtab-select remains unchanged.

## PEtab 3.5.0

Add `log2` transformation for parameters and observable transformations.

## PEtab 3.4.0

Plot updates:

* Makes it possible to provide a parameter vector instead of only a parameter estimation results when plotting model fit.
* Add option to change label in model fit plot to show observable id.

## PEtab 3.3.0

Update to Optimization.jl v4 and DiffEqCallbacks v4.

## PEtab 3.2.0

Added support for running multi-start parameter estimation with `calibrate_multistart` in parallel using `pmap` from Distributed.jl via the `nprocs` keyword. For example, to now run parameter estimation with two processes in parallel, use:

```julia
ms_res = calibrate_multistart(petab_prob, IPNewton(), 50; nprocs = 2)
```

## PEtab 3.1.0

Added support for truncated priors for `PEtabParameter`. Before this update the following would yield an error:

```julia
pk1 = PEtabParameter(:k1; prior = truncated(Normal(1.0, 1.0), 0.0, 3.0))
```

But now it works as expected.

## PEtab 3.0.0

This version is a breaking release prompted by the update of ModelingToolkit to v9 and Catalyst to v14. Along with updating these packages, PEtab.jl also underwent a major update to make the package easier to use. The major changes are:

* A major rewriting of the documentation to make it more accessible. References and more details on the math behind PEtab.jl have also been added to the documentation.
* A near-complete refactoring of the code base to improve maintainability. As a result, any code relying on PEtab.jl internals will likely no longer work.
* Renaming of functions and function arguments to better align with the naming convention in the Julia SciML ecosystem.
* Added support for `ComponentArray` for parameter estimation, making it easier to interact with both the input and output when doing parameter estimation.
* Dropping Zygote.jl support. In previous versions, PEtab.jl supported gradients via `Zygote.gradient` on the objective function. However, this was the slowest gradient method by far, and the hardest to maintain, so it has been removed.

## Changes in defining models

Following the update to ModelingToolkit v9, the syntax for defining models as `ODESystem` has changed. In particular, a model that was previously defined as:

```julia
using ModelingToolkit
@parameters c1, c2, c3, S0
@variables t S(t) SE(t) P(t) E(t)
D = Differential(t)
eqs = [
    D(S) ~ -c1*S*E + c2*SE,
    D(E) ~ -c1*S*E + c2*SE + c3*SE,
    D(SE) ~ c1*S*E - c2*SE - c3*SE,
    D(P) ~ c3*SE
]
@named sys = ODESystem(eqs; defaults=Dict(S => S0, c3 => 1.0, E => 50.0))
```

should now be defined as:

```julia
using ModelingToolkit
using ModelingToolkit: t_nounits as t, D_nounits as D
@mtkmodel SYS begin
    @parameters begin
        S0
        c1
        c2
        c3 = 1.0
    end
    @variables begin
        S(t) = S0
        E(t) = 50.0
        SE(t) = 0.0
        P(t) = 0.0
    end
    @equations begin
        D(S) ~ -c1 * S * E + c2 * SE
        D(E) ~ -c1 * S * E + c2 * SE + c3 * SE
        D(SE) ~ c1 * S * E - c2 * SE - c3 * SE
        D(P) ~ c3 * SE
    end
end
@mtkbuild sys = SYS()
```

Besides the syntax change, we now recommend setting any initial values directly in the model formulation instead of via the default keyword. Similarly, following the update to Catalyst v14, a model that was previously defined as:

```julia
using Catalyst
rn = @reaction_network begin
    @parameters se0
    @species SE(t) = se0
    c1, S + E --> SE
    c2, SE --> S + E
    c3, SE --> P + E
end
speciemap = [:E => 50.0, :SE => 0.0, :P => 0.0]
parametermap = [:c3 => 1.0]
```

should now be defined as:

```julia
using Catalyst
t = default_t()
rn = @reaction_network begin
    @parameters S0 c3=1.0
    @species S(t)=S0
    c1, S + E --> SE
    c2, SE --> S + E
    c3, SE --> P + E
end
speciemap = [:E => 50.0, :SE => 0.0, :P => 0.0]
```

For more information on changes in how to define models, see the Catalyst documentation and the ModelingToolkit documentation.

## Renaming

In PEtab.jl v3, several functions were renamed to better align with the naming convention in the Julia SciML ecosystem. Additionally, a subset of keyword arguments when creating `PEtabODEProblem` and `PEtabModel`, as well as some field names in `PEtabODEProblem`, have been changed. Moreover, neither `PEtabModel` nor `PEtabODEProblem` prints progress by default anymore when building. For an up-to-date list, see the API section in the documentation. Below is a summary.

### Renaming of functions

The following functions have been renamed:

* `calibrate_model` -> `calibrate`
* `calibrate_model_multistart(petab_prob, alg, nmultistarts, dirsave; kwargs...)` -> `calibrate_multistart(petab_prob, alg, nmultistarts; kwargs...)`
    * Note: `dirsave` is now an optional keyword argument.
* `run_PEtab_select` -> `petab_select`
* `generate_startguesses` -> `get_startguesses`
* `remake_PEtab_problem` -> `remake`
* `PEtabMultistartOptimisationResult` -> `PEtabMultistartResult`

The get functions (`get_u0`, `get_ps`, `get_odeproblem`, and `get_odesol`) have also had a keyword argument renamed, specifically `condition_id` is now provided via `cid`. For more details, see the API section in the documentation.

### Renaming in `PEtabODEProblem`

The `PEtabODEProblem` struct has also been updated with new field names. In previous versions, the unknown parameter vector was often referred to as `θ`. Now, the unknown parameter vector to estimate is generally referred to as `x`. Additionally, the following fields in `PEtabODEProblem` have been renamed:

* `prob.compute_cost` -> `prob.nllh`
    * To better reflect that the objective function in PEtab.jl is the negative-log-likelihood.
* `prob.compute_gradient!` -> `prob.grad!`
* `prob.compute_gradient` -> `prob.grad`
* `prob.compute_hessian!` -> `prob.hess!`
* `prob.compute_hessian` -> `prob.hess`
* `prob.compute_chi2` -> `prob.chi2`
* `prob.compute_simulated_values` -> `prob.simulated_values`
* `prob.compute_residuals` -> `prob.residuals`
* `prob.θnames` -> `prob.xnames`

As noted above, `compute` has been dropped from most functions that the `PEtabODEProblem` creates. Additionally, when creating the `PEtabODEProblem`, the following keyword arguments have been renamed:

* `ode_solver` -> `odesolver`
* `ode_solver_gradient` -> `odesolver_gradient`

### Renaming in `PEtabModel`

For creating a `PEtabModel` in Julia, the following keyword arguments have been renamed:

* `state_map` -> `speciemap`
* `parameter_map` -> `parametermap`

Moreover, previously `PEtabModel` had two constructors:

```julia
PEtabModel(sys, simulation_conditions, observables, measurements, parameters; kwargs...)
PEtabModel(sys, observables, measurements, parameters; kwargs...)
```

The first constructor was used if the model had any simulation conditions. This constructor has now been dropped, and the only valid constructor is:

```julia
PEtabModel(sys, observables, measurements, parameters; 
           simulation_conditions = simulation_conditions kwargs...)
```

where `simulation_conditions` is now an optional keyword argument.

## New functions

PEtab.jl has also introduced a new utility function (more information can be found in the documentation):

* `get_x`: Retrieves the nominal parameter vector, with parameters arranged in the correct order expected by a `PEtabODEProblem` for parameter estimation/inference.

## Adding support for ComponentArrays.jl

In previous versions of PEtab.jl, the input to the functions generated by the `PEtabODEProblem`, as well as functions for parameter estimation (e.g., `calibrate`), was expected to be a Julia `Vector`, as the objective and derivative functions created by the `PEtabODEProblem` required a `Vector` input. Since the `PEtabODEProblem` expected the parameters in this input `Vector` to be in a specific order, interacting with the parameter vector became inconvenient, as users had to track both parameter values and names, with names stored separately. Additionally, the default estimation of parameters on the `log10` scale often caused confusion, as this was not apparent with a `Vector` input.

To address these issues, the functions generated by the `PEtabODEProblem`, as well as functions for parameter estimation (e.g., `calibrate`), now support and default to using `ComponentArray`, which is essentially a named vector that stores both the name and value of each parameter. Specifically, previously, PEtab.jl expected input in the form:

```julia
x = petab_prob.θ_nominalT
[0.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```

for `calibrate` or when for example computing the objective function, where the parameter names and expected order were stored in a separate vector (`xnames`). Now, it accepts input in the form:

```julia
x = get_x(petab_prob)
ComponentVector{Float64}(log10_c1 = 0.0, c2 = 2.0, c3 = 3.0)
```

where a potential prefix (e.g., `log10`) specifies the parameter scale (note that the `ComponentArray` must still have parameters with the correct scale in the specified order, but this is automatically handled by functions like `get_x` and `get_startguesses`). In addition to making it easier to identify the parameter scale, this also simplifies interacting with and modifying parameter vectors. For example, to change `c2` in the `ComponentArray`, you can simply do `x[:c2] = 3.0` instead of the previous `x[ic2] = 2.0`, where the index had to be identified using the vector of names.

In summary, the functions related to parameter estimation in PEtab.jl (e.g., functions generated by `PEtabODEProblem` as well as functions like `calibrate`) now support `ComponentArray`. However, all functions still support `Vector` input as well.
