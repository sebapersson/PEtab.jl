# PEtab test case 0011

## Objective

This case tests initial concentrations in the condition table.
For species `B`, the initial concentration is specified in the condition
table, while for `A` it is given via an initial assignment in the SBML model.

## Model

A simple conversion reaction `A <=> B` in a single compartment, following
mass action kinetics.
